Welcome to my game

This game is a simple memory game where each player takes a turn to select 2 tiles to find a match.
If the player finds a matching pair, they get a point and go again.
If they do not find a match, the next player takes a turn.
The game ends when all the matches are found and the player with the mosts points wins.

When the game starts, the player/s have the option of selecting the amount of players and the amount of tiles they would like to play with.

The game is automatically generated depending on the selections on the opening pages and should you decide to manually change these options in the code, the App is bulit in a way that it can accomodate any numeric values entered here.
This is under the condition that an even amount of tiles is selected as the user will always need to find a matching pair to end the game.

Future tasks include:
* adding another selection screen to determine the images that are displayed on the tiles. i.e. the theme.
* giving the players the option of entering their name so that their names are displayed instead of the default "Player 1", "Player 2" etc.
